    abstract = {Ensuring safety in environments where humans and heavy machinery, such as forklifts, share space is critically important. This research investigates pose recognition models for human and forklift detection, focusing on enhancing dataset quality and optimizing detection algorithms aimed at boosting safety compliance within industrial settings and minimizing workplace incidents. We perform a comparative analysis of YOLO based pose estimation frameworks, assessing their ability to deliver real-time monitoring and risk assessment. A significant portion of the project is allocated to developing techniques for generating high-quality synthetic data for scenarios where real-life data collection is challenging. Experimental evaluations in real images of industrial environments are carried out to confirm the system's efficiency, accuracy, and effectiveness in detecting safety risks. While heavier models provided better accuracy in keypoint estimation, such as the Nano version, were 30-43\% faster in detection of Human and Forklift poses. mAP@[.50:.95] scores of 0.68-0.8 were acheived for Humans and more than 0.98 for Fprklift across models. This work also investigated the advantage of incorporatig synthetic data into the dataset. The models were able to predict more instances and robustness in pose estimation on the test set.},
